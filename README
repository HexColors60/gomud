gomud
=====

This is my attempt to learn the Go language. It is a super basic MUD.
Maybe someday it will be fun.

Building
========

    $ go fetch github.com/nathanj/gomud
    $ go build github.com/nathanj/gomud

Playing
=======

If it hasn't crashed, you can connect to the version on my server with:

    $ nc bitcrafter.net 9998

Or, if you want to play on your own local copy:

    $ ./gomud
    $ nc localhost 9998
